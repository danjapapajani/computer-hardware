Labs for ECE342, Winter 2019

## Lab 2
Design an 8x8 Carry Save Multiplier (CSM) with unsigned Booth encoding

## Lab 3
Built a  hardware implementation of Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithmin (LDA) Verilog/SystemVerilog for the DE1-SoC board. The final circuit allows the user  to draw many lines on a VGA monitor using the switches to select starting and ending X/Y coordinates and colours.

## Lab 6
Designed and built a 5 stage processor and implemented it on DE1-SoC board. Processor was then used to run previous LDA.

## Lab 7
Designed and built a 4 stage pipelined processor
